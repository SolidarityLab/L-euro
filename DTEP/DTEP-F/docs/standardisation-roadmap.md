# DTEP-F Standardisation Roadmap

**Version:** 0.1-draft
**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Authors:** CSDT / SolidarityLab

---

## 1. Principle

DTEP-F follows the open source first, standardisation second model. The open source implementation is the technical reference. The standard abstracts implementation specifics into technology-neutral requirements. The standard follows the implementation — not the reverse.

---

## 2. Current Status

**BIS/TC84 draft submission**
CSDT submitted a draft technical specification to the Bulgarian Institute for Standardisation (BIS), Technical Committee TC84 (Electronic Transactions) in May 2026. The draft establishes the regulatory context, the six-layer architecture, and the four analytical primitives as the basis for a national standardisation contribution.

Status: submitted, under TC84 review.

**NGI TALER open source implementation**
The present repository constitutes the open source reference implementation submitted to NGI TALER open call (August 2026). It is the technical evidence base for the standardisation track.

## 3. Standardisation Trajectory

```
BIS/TC84 national draft
        │
        │ national approval
        ▼
CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA)
        │
        │ CWA publication
        ▼
CEN/CENELEC Technical Specification (TS)
        │
        │ TS → EN proposal
        ▼
European Standard (EN)
```

**Parallel track — ISO/IEC JTC1**
Upon CEN/CENELEC TS publication, CSDT will explore submission to ISO/IEC JTC1 SC38 (Cloud Computing and Distributed Platforms) for international standardisation. Timeline dependent on EN track progress.

## 4. Timeline

| Milestone | Target | Dependency |
|---|---|---|
| BIS/TC84 draft approved | Q4 2026 | NGI TALER project start |
| Open source reference implementation v1.0 | Q2 2027 | NGI TALER project completion |
| National sandbox deployment (НАП pilot) | Q3 2027 | TC84 approval + НАП engagement |
| CEN Workshop Agreement proposal | Q4 2027 | v1.0 implementation + sandbox evidence |
| CEN/CENELEC Technical Specification | Q2 2028 | CWA publication |
| European Standard proposal | Q4 2028 | TS publication |
| ViDA DRR mandatory enforcement | 2030-07-01 | Standard must precede enforcement |

The 2028 target for CEN/CENELEC TS is the critical milestone: national tax administrations need 18–24 months for implementation before ViDA mandatory enforcement on 1 July 2030.

---

## 5. Relation to ViDA Enforcement

ViDA DRR becomes mandatory for all EU Member States on 1 July 2030. For DTEP-F to serve as the reference protocol for Corner 5:

- A recognised European standard must exist before 2030
- National tax administrations must have time to implement (18–24 months)
- Therefore, CEN/CENELEC TS must be published by Q2 2028

This timeline is achievable if the BIS/TC84 track and the open source implementation proceed in parallel as planned.

---

## 6. DG TAXUD Positioning

DTEP-F is positioned as a reference implementation for Central VIES 2.0 — the EC infrastructure currently under development by DG TAXUD for real-time cross-border VAT data exchange.

CSDT will engage DG TAXUD through the following channels:
- Peppol ViDA Pilot participation (Corner 5 reference implementer)
- CEN/CENELEC standardisation process (national expert contribution)
- NGI TALER project outputs (open source evidence base)

The VIES Adapter defined in [spec/drrdb-layer.md](../spec/drrdb-layer.md) Section 5 is the technical interface toward Central VIES 2.0.

---

## 7. BIS Membership and TC84

CSDT is a member of the Bulgarian Institute for Standardisation and participates in:
- TC84 — Electronic Transactions (DTEP-F primary committee)
- Banking transactions committee — e-invoicing standards (DTEP-F adjacent)

BIS membership provides direct participation rights in CEN/CENELEC mirror committees, enabling national expert status in the European standardisation process.

## 8. Open Issues

- [ ] TC84 review outcome and feedback integration (Q4 2026)
- [ ] CEN Workshop Agreement scope definition (Q3 2027)
- [ ] DG TAXUD formal engagement strategy (Q2 2027)
- [ ] ISO/IEC JTC1 feasibility assessment (Q4 2028)
